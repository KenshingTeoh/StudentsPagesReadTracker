# StudentsPagesReadTracker
For School Library keep on track of the students on the pages they read

Need from user the excel file name they want to store the data in, and student's name with how many pages they read.
Will add the pages read if the student's name is already exist.

Can change it in the csv excel file that they create and save the file.
